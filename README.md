This simple Python script allows you to play a random number guessing game. The computer generates a random number within a specified range, and you try to guess it.

How to Use

The program will prompt you to enter the lower and upper bounds for the random number.

After setting the bounds, the program will generate a random number within that range.

You can then start guessing the number. The program will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Continue guessing until you correctly identify the random number. The program will display the number of attempts it took.

Functions
getLowerBound(): Prompts the user to input the lower bound for the random number range.

getUpperBound(): Prompts the user to input the upper bound for the random number range.

generateNumber(): Generates a random number within the specified range and displays it.

checkIfDigit(input): Checks if the input is a digit.

guessNumber(): Allows the user to guess the random number, providing feedback on each guess.

main(): The main function that orchestrates the entire game.

Feel free to modify the script according to your preferences or use it as a base for other projects. Enjoy the game!
